          In this lab I needed to:
          <ul id="objectives">
            <li>Draw a white face in the center of the screen</li>
            <li>Move the face around the screen with velocity variables</li>
            <li>Have the face bounce off screen boundaries</li>
            <li>Inverse the face's velocity after it has bounced off a boundary</li>
            <li>Change the face's color after collision with boundary</li>
            <li>Have the program terminate when 'q' is pressed, or when the RMB is clicked.</li>
            <li>Maintain the face's size and shape regardless of screen size</li>
          </ul>

        <h3>My Implementation</h3>

        <div id="implementations">
          <ul id="info">
            <li>I calculated the circle (for the head) by using a GL_POLYGON and splitting the circle into 30 different line segments.</li>
            <li>The eyes also use the circle function as described above, while the mouth was made by a different GL_POLYGON (trapezoidal)</li>
            <li>The face has an initial xVelocity of 0.02 and initial yVelocity of 0.03.</li>
            <li>The face is drawn to screen, its position variables update, the face is cleared from the screen, and then redrawn.</li>
            <li>Movement is simulated by adding xVelocity to the face's xPosition (likewise with the y) everytime the face is drawn.</li>
            <li>The position variables are checked every draw to see if the face is about to go off the screen.</li>
            <li>If the face's position is past the screen boundary, the cooresponding velocity is inverted.</li>
            <li>The face changes color using three random numbers.</li>
          </ul>
